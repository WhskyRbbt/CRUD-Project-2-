# CRUD-Project-2-
  My CRUD app for this project is an app called "crud-app-project-2" I know, super original. It is a character creation app, that allows the user to log in, choose from either a list of characters to edit, or to add a completely new character to thier database.

  The entrance allows you to log in with your Google account, and allow you to set up characters based on your active list, and gives you the option to edit or add a new character via the "Add" tab. log in looks like this:

  This app was built using several technologies, including, but not limited to...
    1. Express.js
    2. Nodejs
    3. MongoDB
    4. Mongoose
    5. Javascript
    6. HTML
    7. CSS

  All this, as well as several libraries and add-ons, this all works together to create a seamless integration that ends with the results of a completed character. It's fun, but there is so much more to do.

  If youre interested in seeing what kind of a character you can make, you can [Enter the Lair](https://git.heroku.com/crud-app-project-2.git) and start customizing your own character today!

  Future updates will include:
    1. New Races, new Battle-Focuses, and new Roles.
    2. Images, (character dispaly, and background images)
    3. Cleaner code for more streamlined efficiency
