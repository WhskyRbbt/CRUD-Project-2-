# CRUD-Project-2-

I intend to make a CRUD app using several techs which are to include newly learned processes, and some new and SHINY authorizatoin techniques. Some of the tech we will use will include HTML, CSS, Javascript, Express.js, Node.js, Mongoose, and OAuth (through Google API).

My app will be a character creation menu for a user to add a character that they can design within certain parameters, and they can see a final copy of the character, as well as some stats, and damage counters associated with the final character. they will be able to add (up to 3) characters, and alter, or delete them to try again.

the User interface will include some optons to start, asking if they would like to see existing characters, or if the ywould like to create a new one. Info about the previous existing character will show on a side bar, and any open slots for characters wll automatically link to the create a character page.

User will be able to choose between several races, classes, and skill sets, as well as a combat focus, determining thier role in a group atmosphere. though there are many classes and roles to choose from, the user can only choose one at a time.
